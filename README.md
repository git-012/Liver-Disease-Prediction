# Liver-Disease-Prediction
Medical Diagnosis of Liver Disease using Machine Learning
This classification project uses clinical patient data to predict the likelihood of liver disease.
#🧾 Project Overview
Built as part of an internship project, the goal is to assist early diagnosis of liver conditions using classification algorithms.
# 📊 Dataset
The model is trained on the **Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)**, comprising medical records from patients across India. Each entry includes features like:
- Age, Gender
- Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin
- Alkaline Phosphatase, Alamine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase
- Total Proteins, Albumin, Albumin and Globulin Ratio
- Target label: `Dataset` (1 = liver disease, 0 = no disease)
